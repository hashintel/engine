## **What is Simulation Modeling?**

\n\n\n\n

Simulation Models seek to demonstrate what happens to environments and agents within them, over time, under varying conditions.

S_imulation Modeling_ is the process of creating and analyzing these models: digital twins or virtual counterparts to physical models or real-world systems.

\n\n\n\n

There are many different ways of constructing Simulation Models, and chief amongst these methods is [Agent-Based Modeling](\"https://hash.ai/wiki/agent-based-modeling\"). In platforms such as [HASH](\"https://hash.ai/platform\"), various techniques for Simulation Modeling can be combined -- for example, Monte Carlo experiments can be run within agent-based or dynamical system models, alongside forms of Finite Element Analysis.

## **How are simulations used?**

\n\n\n\n

_Simulation Modeling_ helps organizations understand and optimize systems that are too large or complex to be reasoned with by humans. It also allows for much faster, automated exploration of the \"possibility space\" of conceivable circumstances, scenarios and environments in which a system might find itself. The \"target systems\" of simulations may vary greatly. Simulation modeling is used in the design of high-tech products like aircraft and satellites, as well as the construction of social networks, organizations, political structures, marketplaces, processes and protocols.

By providing an understanding of how interdependencies within systems might impact one another, over many thousands or millions of runs, the circumstances under which performance may be improved, or under which a system may fail, can be identified and corrected.

## Are Simulation Runs Reproducible?

\n\n\n\n

Where all behaviors are pure functions, and [globals](\"https://docs.hash.ai/core/configuration/basic-properties\") are fixed, results will be perfectly reproducible, provided the same simulation run parameters are passed in.

\n\n\n\n

If a model contains random elements (stochasticity) or relies on external services (e.g. 3rd party APIs), no guarantees can be made around future reproducibility, even in the simulation logic remains unchanged, because the behaviors were not pure functions to begin with. Nevertheless, original simulation run results can be saved and preserved in HASH for future analysis and verification.
